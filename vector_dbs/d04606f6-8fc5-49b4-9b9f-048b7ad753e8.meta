Retrieve relevant content and generate AI responses- Python\n- Streamlit (for web interface)\n- LangChain (for document loading and text splitting)\n- FAISS (for vector storage and similarity search)\n- Ollama (for embeddings and LLM response generation)\n- CSV dataset (indian_food.csv)The main objective of this project is to design a beginner-friendly RAG (Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration) chatbot that can answer user queries strictly based o", "tbot that can answer user queries strictly based on a CSV dataset.\nThe current implementation supports only CSV files. This design choice was made to keep the\nproject simple and beginner-friendly.This project focuses on building a CSV-based chatbot using modern AI tools. The chatbot allows\nusers to upload a CSV file and ask questions related only to the uploaded data. The system\nretrieves relevant information from the CSV and generates accurate responses without\nhallucination.\nOnce a CSV file is", "esponses without\nhallucination.\nOnce a CSV file is uploaded, the chatbot processes the file and creates a vector database. When a\nuser asks a question, the system searches for relevant rows in the CSV and provides the context to\nthe language model, which then generates an accurate response.9. Limitations8. Advantages\n10. Conclusion7. Output and Results\n- Prevents AI hallucination\n- Simple and user-friendly interface\n- Fast retrieval using FAISS\n- Local LLM usage using Ollama\n- Supports only CSV", "Local LLM usage using Ollama\n- Supports only CSV files\n- Answers depend on retrieved chunks\n- Requires Ollama to be running locallyThe chatbot successfully answered questions related to the Indian food dataset, such as identifying\nvegetarian dishes. The responses were accurate and strictly based on the uploaded CSV file.\nThis project demonstrates a practical implementation of a CSV-based RAG chatbot.
